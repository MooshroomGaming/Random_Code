# Random_Stuff

Welcome to the digital chaos. This repo is a big dump of my random code, experiments, and hardware projects. There's no structure, no promises, and definitely no guarantees — just pure, unfiltered tinkering.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** This is not an organized project. It's a living mess of stuff I've built, tested, or played with.

## 🚫 What’s *Not* Included (Yet)

- ❌ G-code or STL files for 3D printing

## 🧪 Why This Repo Exists

This is where I throw code that I don’t want to lose — stuff I’ve built for videos, experiments, testing, or just messing around. Some of it might turn into full projects later. Most of it won’t.

## 🛠️ Contributing

You're welcome to explore, fork, or remix anything. PRs are cool, but only if they fix bugs, organize chaos, or add something useful. Otherwise, enjoy the madness.

MIT License. Use it however you want. If your board fries, your code explodes, or your computer becomes sentient — not my fault.
